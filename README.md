- Activity-Based Suggestions: Whether you are going to work, hitting the gym, or going on a date, Closet Couture will dress you for the occasion.

- Personalized Recommendations: Users will be able to customize their style preferences, including preferred colors, patterns, and clothing types. Closet Couture will learn from your outfit choices and feedback, refining its suggestions to better match your style and preferences over time. While also suggesting clothes it thinks you might like.
